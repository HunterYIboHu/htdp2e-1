; Take a look at this attempt to solve excersice 19:
(define (image-classify img)
  (cond
    [(>= (image-height img) (image-width img)) "tall"]
    [(= (image-height img) (image-width img)) "square"]
    [(<= (image-height img) (image-width img)) "wide"]))

; Use DrRacket's stepper to determine the result of:
(image-classify (circle 3 "solid" "red"))

; Does the stepping suggest how to fix this attempt?
; A: yes.  modify ">=" to ">", "<=" to "<"

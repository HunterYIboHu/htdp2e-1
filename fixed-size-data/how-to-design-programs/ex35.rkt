; Research the "year 2000" problem and what it meant for programmers.

; A: a problem for both digital (computer-related) and non-digital
; documentation and data storage situations that resulted from the
; practice of truncating a four-digit year to two digits.
; This made year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900.

; Companies and organizations worldwide checked, fixed, and upgraded
; their computer systems.
